Negative image formula → s = intensity_max - r 
                         s = (L-1) - r 



Thresholding formula →  s = 255 if r > threshold
                        s = 0 if r <= threshold

Image scaling formula → s = a.r where "a" is a  constant 


Logarithmetic Transformation formula → s = c*Log(1+r) where "c" is a constant usually 1 

       ↠   Also called “dynamic-range compression / expansion”
       ↠   The log function grows faster for smaller inputs and slower for larger inputs.
       ↠   Small input values are spread out in the output (expanded).
       ↠   Large input values are closer together in the output (compressed).
       ↠   Low input values (dark pixels) are mapped to a wider range of output values → easier to see differences in shadows.
       ↠   High input values (bright pixels) are mapped closer together → contrast in bright areas is reduced → compressed.
       ↠   Dark pixels expanded
       ↠   Bright pixels compressed

    [0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 200, 220, 255] → orginal range 
    [0, 110, 165, 190, 220, 244, 248, 255] → after log 

       ↠  Expanded = small differences in input become larger differences in output → easier to see variations
       ↠  Compressed = differences in input become smaller differences in output → harder to see variations
       ↠  Log → stretches dark part, squishes bright part

       ↠  Grey levels must be in the range [0.0, 1.0]


Power law Transformation formula →  s = c*rᵞ    where c and γ must be positive

        ↠ Also called gamma Transformation
        ↠ for γ < 1 dark pixels are expanded (Brightned) and bright pixels are slightly compressed
        ↠ for γ > 1 dark pixels are compressed (Darkned) and bright pixels are expanded
        ↠ γ < 1 brighten image 
        ↠ γ > 1 darken image 
        ↠ gamma > 1 is used in defogging or dehazing
        ↠ gamma < 1 “lifts the veil” from shadow areas

        1️⃣ Enhancing shadows (details hidden in dark regions)

            Problem: Dark regions are too dark → details are invisible.
            Solution: Expand dark pixels, compress bright pixels.
            Effect:
            Dark pixels are mapped over a wider range → differences in shadows are more visible.
            Bright pixels are compressed slightly → prevents highlights from blowing out.
            Example: Gamma < 1 or log transformation.

        2️⃣ Correcting washed-out highlights (fog, haze, or bright areas)

            Problem: Image is brightened or washed out → contrast reduced.
            Solution: Compress dark pixels, expand bright pixels.
            Effect:
            Dark pixels stay darker → shadows regain contrast.
            Bright pixels are stretched → highlights regain definition.
            Example: Gamma > 1 or anti-log transformation.

        Expand → make small differences bigger
        Compress → make differences smaller

    Contrast → Difference between darkest region and brightest region
