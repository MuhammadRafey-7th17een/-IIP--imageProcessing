        Local Operations

Simple Neighbourhood operations
|→ Min
|→ Max
|→ Median

 
Smoothing Spatial Filters
|→ Averaging Filter  
|→ Box Averaging Filter
|→ Gaussian Filter (lowpass filter) [Weighted Averaging Filter]

Formula → e new = ar*bs*ct*du*ev*fw*gx*hy*iz

word mask is also used for filter 

Types of Paddings
|→ Zero
|→ White 
|→ Fixed Value (Gray)
|→ Replicate
|→ Mirror/Reflect
|→ Wrap Around

Correlation & Convolution

Correlation → Sliding the image over the image and direclty multiplying and sum

Convolution → Kernel is flipped (rotated 180°) before sliding
