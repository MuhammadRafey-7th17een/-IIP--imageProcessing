Image Sharpening

→ 2nd order derivative is more useful for image enhancement then 1st order
→ It has stronger response to finer details


Sharpening Filter → Laplacian filter (2nd order derivative)

2D kernels =>       0  1 0      0 -1  0
                    1 -4 1      -1 4 -1                                
                    0  1 0      0 -1  0

                    
                    g(x,y) = f(x,y) - laplacian  if center coefficent is negative
                    g(x,y) = f(x,y) + laplacian if center coefficent is positive

→ Laplacian is also used for edge detection

the kernel 0 -1 0    deals with horizontal and vertical neighbourhoods
           -1 4 -1
           0  -1 0 

→ In edge detection sum of kernel is 0 

→ To deal with vertical, horizontal, and diagonal neighbourhoods we use
        1  1  1
        1 -8  1
        1  1  1 kernel 

→ To sharpen image we do Identity + Edge Detection 

            0 -1  0
            -1 5 -1     is sharpening filter
            0  -1 0

→UnSharpening

USM (UnSharp Masks)

→To make unsharp masks: 1 → Blur the image 
                        2 → Subtract Blurred Image from original, this will give mask (original - blur)
                        3 → Add a weight of the mask to original (original + mask)
High Boost Filtering →  4 → If mask weight > 1, this is called Hight boost filtering


→ Sobel Operators

 →Sobel Operators are first order derivative



-1 0 1          -1 -1 -1
-1 0 1  and      0  0  0        are prewitt filters
-1 0 1           1  1  1


 -1 0 1
 -2 0 2 is horizontal edge
 -1 0 1
                                addition of both edges gives filtered image [ mag =√Gx² + Gy² ]
 -1 -2 -1 
  0  0  0 is vertical edge
  1  2  1



• 1st order derivatives generally produce thicker edges
• 2nd order derivatives have a stronger response to
fine detail e.g. thin lines
• 1st order derivatives have stronger response to grey
level step
• 2nd order derivatives produce a double response at
step changes in grey level
